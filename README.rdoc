= Impromptu

This is my collection of Impromptu (http://impromptu.moso.com.au/) code. Most
of this is experimental.

I plan to use midi-setup.scm and flow.scm to control my live keyboard setup.

= Auto-Loading Code

Copy anything you want loaded to ~/Library/Application Support/Impromptu. See
the comments in bootstrap.scm, which will load init.scm for you.

= ext

The ext subdirectory contains other people's code, downloaded from the
Impromptu site.
